# QAM-Modulation-
Quadrature amplitude modulation with Matlab
In phase shift keying, the carrier phase is modified to represent two or more independent signal components. 
The most extensively used digital-to-analog modulation method is Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, that is composed of ASK and PSK. 
The simplest version of PSK is BPSK, which consists of two signal portions, 
one with a phase of 0° and the other with a phase of 180°
